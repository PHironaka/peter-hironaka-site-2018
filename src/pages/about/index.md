### Established 1987.

Since 2012, I've been a Digital and Social Media Content Producer, working with some of the coolest brands in the world (Nike, Hulu, Old Spice, to name a few).  While I still enjoy Producing Digital content, I've decided to pursue a path as a Web Developer. This website is powered by [Gatsby.js ](gatsbyjs.org)and its content is managed via [Netlify CMS](netlifycms.org).

### Projects and tech stacks I enjoy working on:

* PWAs 
* React
* Templates (Shopify)
* Full Stack Web App Frameworks (Ruby on Rails, Django)
* Agency & Portfolio sites
