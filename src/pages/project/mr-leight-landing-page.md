  Brewing with a Chemex probably seems like a complicated, time-consuming
  ordeal, but once you get used to the process, it becomes a soothing ritual
  that's worth the effort every time.

Mr. Leight was created by the famous father son duo of Larry and Garrett Leight. Handcrafted in Japan, the frames are some of the most premium eyewear in the world today. I had the opportunity to build a simple splash landing page as a precursor to their larger product launch.

I built the single page site with Middleman and deployed via Netlify.
