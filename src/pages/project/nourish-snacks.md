Nourish Snacks offer an assortment of delicious granola bites. As of this Spring, Nourish had a new product launch and wanted to make a few minor adjustments to their schema to help differentiate between Granola Bites and their new products: Popped Ancient Grain Crisps.

I had extensive experience working in Jekyll and was able to make a few customizations on the backend so their team would be able to continue differentiating product types in the future.
