Producing premium content is difficult, which is made all the more difficult without a proper location. Scout Master is a web application designed to help Producer's around the world find and track THE BEST locations.

Scout Master aims to reduce the pre-produciton time allocated towards location scouting. With a database full of locations (curated by the users), it will hopefully increase overall productivity for teams working on tight timelines.
