The Chinatown Market has taken the internet by storm. With extremely in demand bootleg variations of Brands like Patagonia, Nike, Commes Des Garcon and more, TCM has carved out a unique space for themselves within the streetwear community.

I was lucky enough to be able to help redesign their website for them and built a custom Shopify theme.
