A Mood. An Emotion. An Altered State of Being.

Pleasures is an irreverent LA based streetwear label. They wanted to create a site that was more targeted toward their fanbase: it had to load quickly on mobile, the checkout experience needed to be seamless and less cumbersome, and the branding had to be consistent with  their Instagram profile . 

I was responsible for redesigning and developing a custom Shopify theme to meet their needs.
